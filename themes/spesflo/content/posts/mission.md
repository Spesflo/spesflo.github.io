# Spesflo's Mission

 Spesflo’s mission is to help people realize their potential and stop them from wasting it. In today’s world, many of us find ourselves endlessly doomscrolling on various platforms. It’s a waste of time. It messes with our dopamine receptors and slows us down. Imagine how much faster the world could move if everyone stopped scrolling and instead took action—whether it’s calling loved ones, asking someone out, working on their dreams, or any number of other meaningful things. We see this as a “life exam.” Many people remain stuck, while others have already realized the truth.

You may be familiar with the famous quote by Fyodor Dostoyevsky: “The best way to keep a prisoner from escaping is to make sure he never knows he’s in prison.” Our mission is to change this. We care deeply about people, privacy, and security. These days, we're often met with discouraging words: "You can’t do this!" "It’s impossible!" "You’re not smart enough to make it happen!" Unfortunately, these words often come from the people closest to us—family, friends, classmates. But we believe that anything is possible if you trust yourself enough. We want to eliminate the fear of the "what ifs." We want you to trust the process.

We are tired of marketing schemes and attention-grabbing ads that are designed to manipulate. These distractions are everywhere: billboards, posters, social media—practically everywhere in the world. That’s why we came up with the idea of not just motivating you through social media (by turning them from weapons into tools), but also through physical spaces like billboards and posters.

Imagine you’ve shared your big dreams and mission with your loved ones, only to be met with doubt and discouragement. Instead of being bombarded by ads and manipulative marketing, you might see a message of motivation on a billboard or poster. This message would remind you that you can do it and keep pushing forward. This project is starting in the Czech Republic, but we intend to spread it worldwide.

As we’ve mentioned, we value privacy and security. That’s why our website will be distraction-free: no ads, no trackers, no involvement from big tech companies. If one day our website does have ads, they will only promote software that supports personal growth (the same tools we use ourselves).

Our name, Spesflo, comes from two words: “Spes,” which is Latin for “hope,” and “flow,” which perfectly embodies our mission.

This project won’t be easy. We’re tackling big problems with big challenges ahead, and it will be financially demanding. But we trust ourselves. We believe we can make it happen—step by step, little by little.

Join us on this mission. Help us spread the message. Show yourself, yourself.
